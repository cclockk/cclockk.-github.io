The human thirst for knowledge is the driving force behind our successful 
development as a species. But curiosity can also be dangerous, leading to setbacks or even 
downfalls. Given curiosity's complexity, scientists have found it hard to define. 
While pinning down a definition has proven tricky, the general consensus is it's some 
means of information gathering. Psychologists also agree curiosity is intrinsically ( 内在的) 
motivated.  
Curiosity covers such a large set of behaviors that there probably isn't any single 
"curiosity gene" that makes humans wonder about and explore their environment. That said, 
curiosity does have a genetic component. Genes and the environment interact in many 
complex ways to shape individuals and guide their behavior, including their curiosity. 
Regardless of their genetic makeup, infants have to learn an incredible amount of 
information in a short time, and curiosity is one of the tools humans have found to 
accomplish that gigantic task.   
Hundreds of studies show that infants prefer novelty. It's what motivates non-human 
animals, human infants and probably human adults to explore and seek out new things 
before growing less interested in them after continued exposure. 
But curiosity often comes with a cost.   
In some situations, the stakes are low and failure is a healthy part of growth. For 
instance, many babies are perfectly proficient crawlers, but they decide to try walking 
because there's more to see and do when they stand upright. But this milestone comes at a 
small cost. A study of 12- to 19-month-olds learning how to walk documented that these 
children fell down a lot. Seventeen times per hour, to be exact. But walking is faster than 
crawling, so this motivates expert crawlers to transition to walking.   
Sometimes, however, testing out a new idea can lead to disaster. For instance, the Inuit 
people of the Arctic regions have created incredible modes to deal with the challenges of 
living in northern climates, but what we forget about are the tens of thousands of people 
that tried and failed to make it in those challenging landscapes.
