As many office workers adapt to remote work, cities may undergo fundamental change 
if offices remain under-utilized. Who will benefit if working from home becomes the norm? 
Employers argue they make considerable savings on real estate when workers shift 
from office to home work. However, these savings result from passing costs on to workers. 
Unless employees are fully compensated, this could become a variant of parasitic 
( 寄生的) capitalism, whereby corporate profits increasingly rely on extracting value from 
the public- and now personal- realm, rather than on generating new value. 
Though employers are backed by a chorus of remote work advocates, others note the 
loneliness, reduced productivity and inefficiencies of extended remote work. 
If working from home becomes permanent, employees will have to dedicate part of 
their private space to work. This requires purchasing desks, chairs and office equipment. 
It also means having private space dedicated to work: the space must be heated, 
cleaned, maintained and paid for. That depends on many things, but for purposes of 
illustration, I have run some estimates for Montreal. The exercise is simple but 
important, since it brings these costs out of the realm of speculation into the realm of 
meaningful discussion. 
Rough calculations show that the savings made by employers when their staff works 
from home are of similar value to the compensation workers should receive for setting up 
offices at home. 
What does this mean for offices in cities? One of two things may happen: Employers 
pass these costs onto employees. This would be a form of expropriation (侵占), 
with employees absorbing production costs that have traditionally been paid by the 
employer. This represents a considerable transfer of value from employees to employers. 
When employees are properly compensated, employers' real estate savings will 
be modest. If savings are modest, then the many advantages of working in offices-such 
as lively atmosphere, rapidity of communication, team-building and acclimatization 
(适应环境) of new employees-will encourage employers to shelve the idea of remote 
work and, like Yahoo in 2013, encourage employees to work most of the time from 
corporate office space.
