From climate change to the ongoing pandemic (大流行病） and beyond,   
the issues facing today's world are increasingly complex and dynamic.   
Yet solving problems like these requires new approaches that extend beyond traditional ways of thinking.   
A study led by Yale Professor of Psychology, Paul O'Keefe,   
found that having a growth mindset（思维倾向） of interest may spark this type of innovation.   
Professor O'Keefe established in earlier studies that people hold different beliefs about the nature of interest.   
Those with a growth mindset of interest tend to believe that interests can be developed and cultivated,   
while those with a fixed mindset of interest tend to believe   
that interests are inherent （与生俱有的） and simply need to be 'found.'  
Building on these findings, the latest research examined how a growth mindset   
of interest can boost integrative thinking across the traditional disciplinary boundaries of arts and sciences.   
For example, in one task, research participants were instructed to create new college majors   
by combining two or more existing academic Arts or Science programs at their university.   
After coding and analyzing the ideas they generated,   
the team found that people with a growth mindset of interest were more likely   
to bridge programs across the arts   
and sciences to create new majors like computational economics rather than creating majors   
that drew from only one of those areas,   
like computational chemistry.   
As Professor O'Keefe pointed out, "This research provides a useful direction for organizations   
whose products and services call for integrated and creative solutions.   
Take smartphones for example.   
You need not only computer science and engineering knowledge,   
but also an understanding of psychology and visual design to create a better product.  
Employees with a growth mindset may be more likely to devise innovative ideas that bridge  
multiple areas of knowledge to achieve better solutions."  
The benefits of a growth mindset of interest may also extend to those seeking employment.   
This is a pressing issue because many people are becoming unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   
Having a growth mindset of interest can help job seekers expand their interests   
and become more adaptable to different fields, and take the initiative to learn new skills.
