There's a stress gap between men and women   
A) "I used to work very hard. I love to create things, grow them and solve problems, "said 
Meng Li, a successful app developer in San Francisco. "I didn't really care about my 
mind and my body until they decided to go on strike."   
  
B) Ms. Li said her stress led to sleeplessness. When she did sleep, she experienced 
"problem-solving dreams," which left her feeling unrested when she woke up. "After I 
became a first-time mother, I quickly realized I was so busy caring for other people and 
work that I felt like I'd lost myself," she said.   
  
C) It's a common story- one we frequently ridicule and readily dismiss, for example, 
by claiming that women tend to complain more than men, despite the growing sum 
of research that underlines the problem. Women are twice as likely to suffer from 
severe stress and anxiety as men, according to a 2016 study published in The Journal 
of Brain & Behavior. The American Psychological Association reports a gender gap 
year after year showing that women consistently report higher stress levels. Clearly, 
a stress gap exists.   
  
D) "The difference is not really news to me, as a clinical psychologist," said Erin Joyce, 
a women and couples therapist in Los Angeles. "It's been well documented in extensive 
research over the years that prevalence rates for the majority of the anxiety disorders are 
higher in women than men." Some people may argue that this is merely reported data, 
and they say many men feel the same pressures as women in terms of fulfilling 
responsibilities at work and home. In other words, we're all really, really stressed.   
  
E) "The difference, however, is in the nature and scope of these responsibilities in the 
home environment in particular," Dr. Joyce said. For example, the United Nations 
reported that women do nearly three times as much unpaid domestic work as men. The 
problem is, housework is often overlooked as work, even though it is often as laborious 
(or in some cases, more so) as any paid job. As the scholar Silvia Federici put it in 1975, 
the unpaid nature of domestic work reinforces the assumption that "housework is not 
work, thus preventing women from struggling against it. "   
  
F) It's not just inside the home, though. Research from Nova Southeastern University 
found that female managers were more likely than male managers to display "surface 
acting," or forcing emotions that are not wholly felt. "They expressed optimism, 
calmness and sympathy even when these were not the emotions that they were actually 
feeling," the study said.
