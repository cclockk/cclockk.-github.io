It is commonly believed that the great English dramatist   
and poet William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-on-Avon on April 23, 1564.   
But it is impossible to know the exact day on which he was born.

He was 52 and had retired date of death is to Stratford three years before.

he was not a noble, but the son of a leather trader.   
    
Shakespeare probably attended the grammar school in Stratford,   
where he would have studied Latin and read classical literature.

Hamnet and Judith. Nothing is known of the period between the birth of the twins  
and Shakespeare's emergence as a dramatist in London in the early 1590s.

and conflicts with a probably that remains sharp today.
