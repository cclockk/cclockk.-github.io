(5)Tons of gold have fallen out of the sky in Russia after a cargo plane malfunctioned in midair this morning.

The aircraft was carrying 2 65 million pounds worth of gold and diamonds, when the door flew opensending the precious metal back to earth.

According to the official news agency, Russian authorities have recovered more than 170 gold bars weighing 20 kilograms each.

The plane was traveling from Yakutsk Airport in a major diamond-producing region to the city Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.

(6)However, the aircraft made an emergency landing in Magan after it began losing some of its valuable cargo.

Reports suggest some bars of gold were scattered up to 15 miles away from the airport.

Nine tons of gold on plane AN-12 belonged to a goldmine company.

Police have sealed off the runway, and say it is unclear if it was an accident or an attempted robbery.

(7)Technical engineers who worked on the plane prior to take-off are reportedly going to be questioned by the police.
