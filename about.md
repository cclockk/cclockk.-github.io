(16)A new study carried out by the University of Lincoln has found a link between the personalities of cat owners and the behaviour and wellbeing of their cats.<br> The findings suggest that, just as a parent's personality can affect the personality of a child, the same is true for a cat and its owner.<br> Owners-defined as individuals with high levels of anxiety, fear, anger, depression and loneliness-were more likely to have cats with behavioural issues.<br> Such cats displayed more aggressive and anxious behavioural styles as well as more stress-related sickness.<br> They were also more likely to have an ongoing medical condition and be overweight.<br> The research also found that mentally well-adjusted owners had calme r, happier and healthier cats.<br> The researchers explained that "Many owners regard their pets as a family member, and form close social bonds with them.<br>" (17)The majority of owners want to provide the best care for their pets and it's therefore possible that pets could be affected by the way their owners interact with and manage them.<br> ( 18) The study highlights an important relationship between our personalities and the wellbeing of our pets.<br> Further research is needed to investigate the causal nature of this relationship and to look at how owners' personalities are directly influencing their pets' behaviour and wellbeing.<br> It is possible that the wellbeing of pets is driven by the underlying nature of the owner, not simply by their conscious decisions and behaviours.<br> 

  
  
(19-l)"One 60 -minute run can add seven hours to your life .<br>" This was a claim made by The Times last week .<br>
The claim was based on a new review of studies about the effects of running.<br>
( 19-2) The review concluded that on average runners live three years longer than non-runners and that running does more to extend life than any other form of exercise .<br>
But there 's more to running than its health benefits .<br>
(20)Research published in recent years has shown that running changes your brain and mind in some fascinating ways, from inc reasing your brain function to regulating your emotions.<br>
However, the precise effects vary according to whether you engage in short, fast running or long-distance running.<br>
For example, in one study, researchers compared participants' ability to learn new words after several minutes of intense running and after 40 minutes of gentle running.<br>
Participants were able to learn 20 percent faster after the intense running and they showed a superior memory when tested again a week later.<br>
In another study, researchers asked volunteers to jog for 30 minutes and then showed them clips from a sad movie.<br>
Participants who usually struggled to handle negative emotions were more intensely affected by the sad clips, just as you'd expect.<br>
(21) But crucially, this was less so if they had completed the 30-minute jog.<br>
The researchers said moderate exercise appears to have helped those participants to be less vulnerable to the impact of the sad movie.<br>

  
    
(22-l)Welcome to the tour of the Hill House.<br>
This house built in 1904 is one of the most well-knownworks of Charles Hill, the famous architect.<br>
It was designed and built for a local entrepreneur and his family.<br>
(22-2) Before starting the tour, let me give you a brief introduction about the design of this amazing building.<br>
(23)Prior to beginning his design, the architect spent some time in the client's old home , observing theirlife and studying their habits.<br>
This meant that he could design the house according to the needs of the family.<br>
(24) The client's main desire was to have a home with the unique design, so the architect was givencomplete freedom.<br>
The building style is radically different from what was the fashion of the period.<br>
At thetime , most large homes were constructed of timber and brick.<br>
This one , however, is made of concrete , a novelconstruction material in those days.<br>
The interior of the house, including fittings and furniture , was alsodesigned by the same person.<br>
Most of the furniture you will see is original and in good condition.<br>
However,(25)those pieces in the children's bedrooms are copies built to the designs of the architect.<br>
Fortunately, all theblueprints for both the building and its contents have been preserved, so we've been able to replace badlydamaged furniture.<br>
(22-3)Let's begin our tour, starting from the rooms.<br>
