Many people believe that passion and commitment are the foundations of strong romantic relationships. 
But a relationship is made of two unique individuals.   
And the personality traits these individuals possess or lack can often make a relationship more-or less-likely to endure.   
Recent research has found that one trait in particular humility is an important indicator of successful relationships.   
Humility can sometimes be confused with a lack of confidence.  
But researchers have come to realize that being humble generally indicates the presence of deeply admirable personal qualities.   
Being humble means you have the ability to accurately assess your deficiencies without denying your skills and strengths.  
For example, you might recognize that you are intelligent, but realize that you are not a  genius.   
Thus, humility leads to an honest view of one's own advantages and shortcomings.   
Humble people do not ignore, avoid, or try to deny their limits or deficiencies.   
They can acknowledge mistakes, see value in things that are far from perfect and identify areas for improvement.   
Perhaps it is not surprising then, that humility appears to be a huge asset to relationships.   
One study found that people tend to rate this quality highly in their spouse.   
The study also found that someone who is humble is more likely to initiate a romantic relationship, perhaps because they are less likely to see themselves as "too good" for someone else.   
Thus, a humble partner might be your ideal partner.
