How to not be boring 
A) Humans are creatures of habit. We love to establish a routine and stick with it.   
Then we often put ourselves on auto-pilot. Routines can be incredibly useful in helping you getthings done.   
However, too much of a routine can also make you incredibly boring.  
Nevertheless, many people live lives that are boringly predictable, or live a life where everything is outlined or planned.
    
B) To tell the truth, interesting people are more popular among their friends.  
If you don't arouse someone's curiosity or brighten someone's day, you probably come across asbeing a little bit dull.     
But that doesn't mean your life has ended and you can't do anything to change it.   
If you find yourself searching for something to say beyond small talk, try these tactics to find more interesting approaches to conversation.
    
C) Recently, I was at a gathering of colleagues when someone turned to me and asked,  
"So, what's new with you?" Ordinarily, I think I'm a good conversationalist.   
After all,it's literally my job to talk to people and tell their stories or share their advice. 
And that's not exactly an unexpected question.   
Still, the only "new-to-me" topics that came to mind were my daughter's basketball tournament（锦标赛）  
and my feelings about that morning's political headlines- neither amusing nor appropriate topics at that moment.
    
D) Oh, no, I thought. Have I become boring?   
But sharing our experiences in an authentic way to connect with other people is what makes us interesting, 
says associate professor Michael Pirson.   
The hesitation I felt in not sharing the ordinary things that were happening in my life,   
and the wild mental search for something more interesting, may have backfired and made me seem less interesting.  
  
E) "If someone is making up some conversation that might be interesting, it's probably not going to land well," says Pirson,   
whose expertise includes trust and well-being,mindfulness, and humanistic management.   
"It's going to feel like a made-up conversation that people don't necessarily want to tune in to ."  
  
F) The most interesting people aren't those who've gone on some Eat, Pray, Love journey to find themselves. 
Instead, Pirson says, they're those who examine the ordinary.   
"Often,the 'boring things' may not be boring at all. Maybe they are actually little miracles," he says.   
Share your observations about the world around you —interesting stories you heard or things you noticed—and you may be surprised by the universal connection
they inspire.
