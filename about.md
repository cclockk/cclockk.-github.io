Nationwide, only about three percent of early childhood teachers are male in the U. S.Experts say   
this can have an impact on young children   
whose understanding of gender roles and identity are rapidly forming.   
Research has found that having access to diverse teachers is beneficial for children.   
For the youngest learners,   
it means they are more likely to getexposed to different varieties of play and communication.   
It also helps them develop healthy ideas around gender.  
  
“In our world and our society,we have very specific stereotypes（模式化形象）of gender roles," said Mindi Reich-Shapiro,   
an assistant professor in the teacher education department of the Borough of Manhattan Community College,   
and one of the authors of a recent study.   
"It's important for children to see other possibilities and other paths they can take.  
  
Despite mostly feeling supported by colleagues and family members,   
many of the male educators surveyed in the study reported facing social   
or cultural resistance in their careers as early education teachers.   
Some also reported that there were parents surprised   
or concerned that their child had a male teacher.   
And they had been advised by colleagues or other staff not to hug children.  
  
Reich-Shapiro and fellow researchers made several recommendations to increase male representation in the field.   
Low pay has long been acknowledged as a major issue in the early childhood field.   
Over 70% of male educators who said   
they intended to stay in the early education workforce noted an increased salary   
was a major motivating factor for them to commit to the career long-term.   
The report suggests paying all early childhood educators the way elementary school teachers are paid.  
  
Cities and programs should establish support groups for male early childhood educators   
and provide mentoring and professional development advice for male educators  
and their program leaders.  
  
The authors also suggest that traditional recruitment approaches for early childhood educators   
"do not address the gender gap in the field."   
They recommend providing young men opportunities to work with children through training and volunteer programs,   
targeting groups of men who are considering a career change, such as fathers.
