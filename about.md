The dog owner's beloved 10-year-old dog named Buddy took an unexpected 16-hour flight to Tokyo following a mix-up by the airline.   
The dog owner's family are currently in the process of moving.   
They were meant to be reunited with the pet in their new home city in Texas.

"I'm so glad he's alive and coming home soon ! " said the relieved dog owner.
